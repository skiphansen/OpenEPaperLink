This is Skip's personal fork of the OpenEPaperLink project with additional content
and features.

## Why?

1. Provide ability to easily release Betas of new features before merging with main repo.
1. Some of my additional content types is of limited interest to the general community.
2. I have a limited ability in testing all of the AP types supported by the OpenEPaperLink.

The OpenEPaperLink project supports a **LARGE** number of AP types some of which have very
limited resources.  I only have a small subset of the APs and I have no interest 
in AP types with limited flash or PSRAM.  

Since I can't test my changes on these APs I don't want to risk breaking 
something for someone with my changes that they may not need or want.

Some of the new content is of limited interest to the general OpenEPaperLink. 
community and it would be wasteful of the limited AP resources to include the code.

Examples:
1. NOAA tides:   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
is a United States government agency which only provides tide data for US
territories. The vast majority of current OEPL users do not appear to reside
in the US so this content is probably of little interest to them.

2. Septic tank monitor (TODO) : Hopefully most people who even have a septic 
tank has one that works better than mine and it doesn't need monitoring!
